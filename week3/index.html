      <p>
        The Searl Effect was discovered by John Roy Robert Searl in 1946.
Put simply, it is a method of extracting clean and sustainable electrical energy.
The SEG consists of three fixed stator rings that are uniquely magnetized with patterns setup to generate continual motion of similarly magnetized cylindrical rotors. The magnetic rotors or rollers consist of eight segmented components made of the same four layers of concentric materials that make up the stators. The rollers have both freedom of spin and rotation around the stator which generates both mechanical and electrical power.
The SEG is an 'open system' of energy conversion that is in accordance with known thermodynamic laws; particularly as it may apply at the quantum level. The open energy cycle of the SEG enables it to function both as a prime mover of mechanical rotors, but more so as an electrical generator that continuously interacts and processes energy from the natural environment.
Incidental effects includes a halo of negative air ionization or plasma, vacuum by extreme electrical charge, cooling temperatures of both device and the local environment; also gravitational and inertial anomalies under specific conditions.
The Searl Effect is based on magnetic waveforms that generates a continual motion of magnetized rollers around magnetized rings.
Energy conversion while operating involves processing of random quantum fluctuations and kinetic energy within the atomic lattice into coherent currents of electron pairs formed between two-dimensional boundaries of different type materials. Therein between surface boundaries, the Quantum Hall Effect of a strong pulsing magnetic field are electron transformations (compression) that dramatically decreases the device temperature with increasing mean free paths (conductivity) due to the increase in fermion pair formations or bosons tunneling through all of the concentric material layers of the Searl Effect Generator.
Energy out of the environment is typically chaotic but pervasive at the quantum level and we all feel it in part as ambient temperatures, but this is just one source of ambient energy within the electromagnetic spectrum that is in a random state and is readily utilized by the SEG. It is in effect an unbiased solid state magnetic diode that can effectively turn ambient energy into asymmetrical electron motion out of randomness into a uniform state or non-random state of coherent currents, consisting of high velocity tunneling electrons pairs with photon like characteristics.
Searl Effect Technology effectively utilizes quantum kinetic energy which involves the electron’s inherent ability to absorb and emit energy at the quantum level with an energy cycle that can could compared and explained in layman terms to the hydroelectric dam in principle since both are driven directly or indirectly by entropy of the sun's radiant energy. A dam builds up potential and kinetic energy by way of cloud condensation that forms rain and fills reservoirs, but does so only after it has achieved a higher energy level by way of evaporation from ground levels. Whereas the SEG utilizes its layer of neodymium as a reservoir of electrons, Teflon layer is analogous to the dam itself, Magnetic layer as the power plant that makes useful work out of the currents and finally the copper layer that compares well to the water outlets that can be seen to jet out at the bottom of the dam; similarly the SEG ram-jets electrons out to the atmosphere. At this point, energy levels of the water jets or in the case of electrons, are kinetically reduced existing the system, but be mindful that these discharges go back to the environment to recharge. Therein, ambient energy restores their energy levels up by way of evaporation of water or as with the SEG, the uniform emission of electrons to the outside air exposes them to atmosphere’s ambient sources of energy or temperature which raises the electron’s quantum energy levels back up to natural ambient levels. Thereafter, the external sources of electrons are attracted back to the relatively positive potential of the electron depleted neodymium layer (reservoir) where the energy cycle continuously repeats. It is a process that effectively strips kinetic energy out the of electrons before they are emitted; no different in principle from the energy cycle of the hydroelectric dam where the kinetics of the water flow are harnessed. In this manner, both ways gather ambient sources of energy that can be processed and made useful for electrical applications.
The idea of utilizing unlimited sources of energy is the subject of various devices and experiments, most of which prove the existence of energy at the quantum level but not a method of creating a coherent and uniform flow of energy to produce useful electrical power. In contrast, John Searl discovered that in order to create a steady and stable flow, all the masses of the device (and the stimulating frequencies) must conform to precise values which are determined by a matrix of coherent numbers he calls the "Law of the Squares". The SEG’s ability harness the electron’s kinetic energy itself is a unique achievement that represents a new technology working with the highest quality of energy that nature has to offer and it is clean, non-destructive, unlimited and all-pervading.
This all describes a constant source of energy that can be made to flow when the correctly proportioned masses concerned are stimulated by suitable magnetic field frequencies along with the appropriate generator design. The SEG is such a device, precisely constructed to these principles, enabling it to produce stable and useful electrical power that is scalable in size for output requirement.
The size of an SEG can range from the smallest design of about one meter in diameter of 15 kilowatt capacity (which is suitable for most households) to well over a megawatt. They can be setup in tandem to make up a power plant to supply the electrical needs of an entire city.
The SEG technology has all the hallmarks of a World Class solution for today’s energy needs and it is expected to be the dominant form of energy production of the future.The Searl Effect Generator (SEG) functions along the principles of a linear induction motor (LIM), but designed around a circular track for continuous motion of movable rotors. It is a magnetic prime mover of electromagnetic multi-phased cylindrical rollers over fixed stator rings and free of any mechanical wear or friction.
The SEG’s stators and rollers are magnetic components uniquely magnetized or imprinted with matching magnetic pole patterns.
While the neodymium layer serves as a source or reservoir of electron charges that are drawn out by electromagnetic induction. These redial currents though the rollers makes for mechnical motion at right angles to both the electric and magnetic fields.
The SEG configuration of rollers in motion, cuts through the magnetic flux with a unique cycloid pattern that is superimposed over an orbit around the circumference of the stator. In this manner, each roller can also induce eddy currents of mutual induction between the copper surfaces to form a frictionless ‘magnetic bearing’ as it generates radial electrical potentials. Frictionless operation enables the SEG to operate without physical wear and thus enabling it to operate with a service expectancy of a lifetime.

      <h2 class="text-center" id="anti">Antikythera Mechanism</h2>
      <p>
        The Antikythera mechanism (/ˌæntɪkɪˈθɪərə/, /ˌæntɪˈkɪθərə/) is an ancient hand powered Greek analogue computer which has also been described as the first example of such device used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance. It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.

This artefact was retrieved from the sea in 1901, and identified on 17 May 1902 as containing a gear by archaeologist Valerios Stais, among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera. The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87 BC, or between 150 and 100 BC, or to 205 BC, or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to approximately 70–60 BC.[25][26]

The device, housed in the remains of a 34 cm × 18 cm × 9 cm (13.4 in × 7.1 in × 3.5 in) wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others. The largest gear is approximately 14 centimetres (5.5 in) in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.

It is a complex clockwork mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears. A team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at Cardiff University used modern computer x-ray tomography and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine.

Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests that it had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and even to model the irregular orbit of the Moon, where the Moon's velocity is higher in its perigee than in its apogee. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes, and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.
The knowledge of this technology was lost at some point in antiquity. Similar technological works later appeared in the medieval Byzantine and Islamic worlds, but works with similar complexity did not appear again until the development of mechanical astronomical clocks in Europe in the fourteenth century. All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are now kept at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions and replicas of the mechanism to demonstrate how it may have looked and worked.The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known analogue computer. The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it must have had undiscovered predecessors made during the Hellenistic period. Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC[13] or the early first century BC.

In 1974, Derek de Solla Price concluded from gear settings and inscriptions on the mechanism's faces that it was made about 87 BC and lost only a few years later. Jacques Cousteau and associates visited the wreck in 1976 and recovered coins dated between 76 and 67 BC. The mechanism's advanced state of corrosion has made it impossible to perform an accurate compositional analysis, but it is believed that the device was made of a low-tin bronze alloy (of approximately 95% copper, 5% tin). Its instructions were composed in Koine Greek.

In 2008, continued research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested that the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of Corinth, since they identified the calendar on the Metonic Spiral as coming from Corinth or one of its colonies in Northwest Greece or Sicily. Syracuse was a colony of Corinth and the home of Archimedes, and the Antikythera Mechanism Research project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes. However, it has recently been demonstrated that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is indeed of the Corinthian type but cannot be that of Syracuse. Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device's construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of Pergamon, home of the Library of Pergamum. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the Library of Alexandria during the Hellenistic period.

      <h2 class="text-center" id="zhang">Zhang Heng’s Seismoscope</h2>
      <p>
        In 132 CE, inventor, Imperial Historian, and Royal Astronomer Zhang Heng displayed his amazing earthquake-detection machine, or seismoscope, at the court of the Han Dynasty. Zhang's seismoscope was a giant bronze vessel, resembling a barrel almost 6 feet in diameter. Eight dragons snaked face-down along the outside of the barrel, marking the primary compass directions. In each dragon's mouth was a small bronze ball. Beneath the dragons sat eight bronze toads, with their broad mouths gaping to receive the balls.The exact mechanism that caused a ball to drop in the event of an earthquake also is not known. One theory is that a thin stick was set loosely down the center of the barrel. An earthquake would cause the stick to topple over in the direction of the seismic shock, triggering one of the dragons to open its mouth and release the bronze ball.

Another theory posits that a baton was suspended from the lid of the instrument as a free-swinging pendulum. When the pendulum swung widely enough to strike the side of the barrel, it would cause the closest dragon to release its ball. The sound of the ball striking the toad's mouth would alert observers to the earthquake. This would give a rough indication of the earthquake's direction of origin, but it did not provide any information about the intensity of the tremors.Zhang's wonderful machine was called houfeng didong yi, meaning "an instrument for measuring the winds and the movements of the Earth." In earthquake-prone China, this was an important invention. 

In one instance, just six years after the device was invented, a large quake estimated at a magnitude seven struck what is now Gansu Province. People in the Han Dynasty's capital city of Luoyang, 1,000 miles away, did not feel the shock. However, the seismoscope alerted the emperor's government to the fact that a quake had struck somewhere to the west. This is the first known instance of scientific equipment detecting an earthquake that had not been felt by humans in the area. The seismoscope's findings were confirmed several days later when messengers arrived in Luoyang to report a major earthquake in Gansu.
